Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4/Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6/Turn on execshield protection/Prevent against the common ‘syn flood attack’/Turn on source IP address verification/Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address of the server/Logs several types of suspicious packets, such as spoofed packets, source-routed packets, and redirects.
