# Simple-Network-Garderning

Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, so now i will explain a simple or easy Harderning related to Networking (sysctl.conf)

As the /etc/sysctl.conf file is used to override default kernel parameter values, only a small number of parameters is predefined in the file. sysctl.conf is a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in and set by sysctl. The syntax is simply as follows:

              # comment
              ; comment

              token = value
